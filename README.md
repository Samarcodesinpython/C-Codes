## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a collection of C programs that demonstrate different programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms. Each file is a standalone project or exercise that I've completed during my studies.

## Practiced Concepts

Here are some of the key concepts and topics covered in this repository:

- Basic C syntax and structure
- Control flow statements (if, switch, loops)
- Functions and recursion
- Arrays and strings
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- Data structures: Linked lists, stacks, queues, trees
- Algorithms: Sorting, searching, and more

## Code Structure

Each C file is organized as follows:

- **File name:** `exercise_name.c`
- **Description:** At the top of each file, youâ€™ll find comments explaining the purpose of the code and any specific requirements or algorithms used.

## Usage

To run the C programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
